/* 
Playwright, by default, runs tests in parallel. When running the whole suite, the second test may start before the first 
test finishes, leading to the second test failing due to the lack of a logged-in state.

To run tests sequentially within a describe block, you can use Playwrightâ€™s ability to run tests in a serial manner. 
This ensures that each test waits for the previous one to finish before starting. However, there is no built-in support 
to run tests sequentially within a single describe block, but you can control this behavior using hooks and careful test sructuring.
